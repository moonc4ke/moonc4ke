## Hi there!

Just developer trying to make interesting stuff mostly with Rails
and trying to escape never ending Javascript ecosystem nightmare.

DHH is a cool dude and I admire him a lot. Hope one day I can 
write awesome code like DHH. But I guess I spend way to much time
in the gym and planning my next surf trip.. Ahhh what a vicous cycle.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on OutdoorSync - hopefully will be a cool and usefull project.
You can check it here -> [OutdoorSync Repo](https://github.com/moonc4ke/outdoor-sync)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently still learning Rails. After all this crazy stuff with Javascript, 
I just want to find an escape from never ending meta frameworks bs and bring back joy
to web development.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Donce.dev](https://donce.dev/) if for some reason my personal
website is not working I might have broken up something or just my server is down.

âš¡ Fun fact:
* I probably workout more than I code.
* Always thinking about my next surf trip.
* Offce you say? I say "Please, NO!"
* Started developing in 2008, but I'm still not a millionaire like DHH. What the ..?
* Still reading One Piece.
* Favorite anime is Mashle: Magic and Muscles. And I think you know why.
* Neovim is my favorite editor, ahh sorry, not Neovim, but Lazyvim.
